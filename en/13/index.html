<p>On July 19th, 2021, Sonja Lang has released an additional official toki pona
book, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0978292367">Toki Pona Dictionary</a>&rdquo; (also known
as &ldquo;ku&rdquo; or &ldquo;lipu ku&rdquo;). This book provides translations from English to toki pona
and vice versa for a whole lot of words, compiled from a community poll ran on
the toki pona community in 2020-2021, and documents 61 additional words used in
the language for a total of 181 &ldquo;nimi ku&rdquo;. While most of these words are rarely
used in the community, there are 17 extra &ldquo;nimi ku suli&rdquo; words that have been
deemed frequent and important enough to be listed separately. This page shall
cover these new words.</p>

<p>The words &ldquo;namako&rdquo;, &ldquo;kin&rdquo; and &ldquo;oko&rdquo; were listed as synonyms for &ldquo;sin&rdquo;, &ldquo;a&rdquo; and
&ldquo;lukin&rdquo; respectively in <em>lipu pu</em>. However, in the community, these words have
somewhat different meanings:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;sin&rdquo; typically means &ldquo;new&rdquo;, &ldquo;namako&rdquo; typically means &ldquo;additional&rdquo; or &ldquo;extra&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;kin&rdquo; is used at the end of sentences for &ldquo;also&rdquo; or &ldquo;too&rdquo;. &ldquo;a&rdquo; does not have
such a specific usage.</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;oko&rdquo; specifically means &ldquo;eye&rdquo;, while &ldquo;lukin&rdquo; also means &ldquo;vision&rdquo; and &ldquo;to
see&rdquo;.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The words &ldquo;kipisi&rdquo;, &ldquo;leko&rdquo;, &ldquo;monsuta&rdquo; and &ldquo;misikeke&rdquo; were early words invented
before <em>lipu pu</em>&rsquo;s publishing, and they are still used in the community today.
Some of these words were invented by Sonja Lang herself, such as
&ldquo;kijetesantakalu&rdquo; and &ldquo;misikeke&rdquo; (the former as a joke word, which ended up
being well-received by the toki pona community).</p>

<p>The rest are specifically newly-added words. Specifically, the word &ldquo;ku&rdquo; was
invented by Sonja Lang as an counterpart to &ldquo;pu&rdquo; to describe interacting with
the second official toki pona book.</p>

<div class="info"><p>You may choose to use these words or to avoid them. I personally prefer using
only the vocabulary defined in the <em>lipu pu</em>, and only use additional words
when absolutely necessary. But it&rsquo;s always helpful to learn the most common
additional words and to know what they mean (See also: <a href="x1">extra page
1</a>).</p></div>

<p>Now, try to figure out the meaning of these sentences.</p>

<ul>
<li>kijetesantakalu li soweli epiku.</li>
<li>kulupu tonsi li pilin monsuta ala.</li>
<li>jan pi pona sijelo li pana e misikeke tawa mi.</li>
<li>sina wile suli e sona sina la o ku.</li>
<li>sitelen tawa ni li meso.</li>
</ul>


<p>And try to translate the following sentences into toki pona. (The answers page
will provide both <em>nimi pu</em> and <em>nimi ku</em> answers.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Fire scares me.</li>
<li>Why aren&rsquo;t you speaking in toki pona?</li>
<li>Wear goggles, so that you don&rsquo;t damage your eyes.</li>
<li>Please pass me the sugar (&ldquo;white sweet spice&rdquo;).</li>
<li>How would you want me to cut the pizza (&ldquo;bread circle&rdquo;)?</li>
</ul>
